## 🔐 Security Considerations

The current project is a frontend-only landing page. When converting this into a production e-commerce store, ensure:
- Passwords, payment credentials, and private API keys are never stored in client-side code.
- Server-side validation and secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, GCash, Maya) are utilized.
- Communications are encrypted via HTTPS with properly configured authentication cookies and rate limiting.
